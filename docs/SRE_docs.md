## SLIs and SLOs

### Service Level Indicators (SLIs)
1. **Availability:**
   - **Definition:** Measures the proportion of successful CI/CD pipeline runs.
   - **Metric:** `successful_runs / total_runs`

2. **Latency:**
   - **Definition:** Measures the time taken to complete a CI/CD pipeline run.
   - **Metric:** `average_pipeline_duration`

3. **Error Rate:**
   - **Definition:** Measures the proportion of failed CI/CD pipeline runs.
   - **Metric:** `failed_runs / total_runs`

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
1. **Availability SLO:**
   - **Objective:** 99.9% of CI/CD pipeline runs should be successful.
   - **SLI:** Availability

2. **Latency SLO:**
   - **Objective:** 95% of CI/CD pipeline runs should complete within 10 minutes.
   - **SLI:** Latency

3. **Error Rate SLO:**
   - **Objective:** Less than 1% of CI/CD pipeline runs should fail.
   - **SLI:** Error Rate
